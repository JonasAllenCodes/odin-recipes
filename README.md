# Odin Recipes

## Pre-Mission Statement
*11-01-2023*
This is a project on The Odin Project. I am taking the fundamentals course, and this is part of the HTML Foundations section. I am just refreshing my knowedlge with current best practices after a long hideas from web development.

In this projrct we will go over the basics of HTML Foundations by builing a recipe website. This will be a basic website with no style. We will practice the HTML boilerplate, working with text, lists, links, and images. We will also work on the best practices of commit messages.

This should be an easy project that I already have experience with. To  the finish line!

## Post Mission Statement
*TBA - To Be Announced*
