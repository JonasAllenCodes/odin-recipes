# Odin Recipes

## Pre-Mission Statement
*11-01-2023*

This is a project on The Odin Project. I am taking the fundamentals course, and this is part of the HTML Foundations section. I am just refreshing my knowledge with current best practices after a long hideas from web development.

In this project we will go over the basics of HTML Foundations by building a recipe website. This will be a basic website with no style. We will practice the HTML boilerplate, working with text, lists, links, and images. We will also work on the best practices of commit messages.

This should be an easy project that I already have experience with. To  the finish line!

## Post Mission Statement
*11-01-2023*

Project is complete for lesson standards. After I refresh the CSS Foundations, I will come back and style this project. Lesson was an easy refresher but tedious to build out the lists. I was almost tempted to have AI build out the list format for me! ;p
